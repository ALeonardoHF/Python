"""Wild"" I really get the feeling that the book is way better than the movie, which I'll read one day for sure but the movie was still good. Confusing with the out of order flashbacks but quite the journey and portrayed the female experience well, well I assume.",1
"45 years ago today, the slap heard round the world",1
"After 30+ minutes of watching The Joker, I’ve determined it’s really bad. I understand liking the acting or the music or the art of the movie, but otherwise it’s really doing nothing for me.",0
"Although I do enjoy some of Eminem’s music, I was not particularly interested in watching this movie. After doing so though, it hit me. This is Rocky, if the punches were verbal. Some solid acting, yes, even from Em, and an enjoyable underdog story.",1
BadBoysForLife has not lose The old vibes but in this case is talking more seriously GoodMovie,1
"Blame any of the weird, odd, horrible movies I watch and write about on How Did This Get Made? Movies like Cool World and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. ",0
Cant decide what is the worst film I have seen in the last 12 months. Hereditary or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.,0
"Finally watched Richard Jewell. What a surprisingly touching and interesting movie. Well done, Clint!",1

How did I miss seeing this movie...?! A good friend sent me a video from it & I ended up watching the movie.,1
I don’t have much for you this 4th of July. Just me enjoying Back to the Future.,1
"I enjoyed sugar rush, I have seen it more than twice, it's a comedy. I love that they were realistic, Because me I did the math of $800k was wondering how they got a house,tickets&visas also did shopping and still wanna buy 3 G-wagons like seriously",1
"I hope very little of that horrible, awful disaster of a movie makes it into the sequel. Having said that, I will definitely devour it on release day. But still. That movie. Almost as bad as Eragon. Or ... I don't know. Really most book adaptations. Bad.",0
"I just finished watching Replicas on Netflix. Possibly, one of Keanu’s worst movies. Talk about a zombie performance. I give this movie maybe 1 out of 5. Predictable as all Hell. The whole cast had absolutely no energy at all.",0
I thought mela was the worst movie ever..,0
I waited over 15 years for them to turn artemisfowl into a movie. I loved the series. I got 15 minutes into the movie and quit. I've never been so disappointed. ,0
If you haven’t seen the movie The Outpost staring Scott Eastwood I would 100% recommend it was awesome. But the real question is when can we get a western with Clint and Scott Eastwood in the same movie it would be Legendary,1
"If you’re looking for something to make you smile and laugh, go give EurovisionMovie a watch",1
"In my opinion, the worst movie of all time is TWISTER. And why, because it features EVIL METEOROLOGISTS! Yep, evil meteorologists. So, what's yours and why?",0

Jurassic Park will never get old,1
"Just finished watching Joker. Welp, that's 2 hours of my life that I can't get back!",0
Just watched White House Down. I didn't think a movie could be more ridiculous than Olympus Has Fallen. I was wrong.,0
"Krull is a movie that is a mix between Zelda and Star Wars, where there magic and swords but laser guns. With that, it's worth a single watch, and then just try to remember you've watched it. ",1
"Man, just thinking about how horrible that Monster Hunter movie is going to be and how it's making me want to watch it for the complete worst reasons. I never wanted to hate watch a movie so bad.",0
"man, sucker punch is a really honkin bad movie",0
"Movie review: Red State, 7/10. It is a very strange and uncomfortable film, but that adds to what makes it good. An angering and wild story with strong cinematography and well-crafted dialogue drives the strange acting to crate something rather interesting.",1
"Not sure how I feel about this. Ready Player One was fantastic, but Armada was not good, and Cline's adapted screenplay for the RP1 movie was terrible.",0
Not sure why it's taken me this long to watch this but I'm happy I never missed out. Awesome film and it was unexpectedly really funny!! Kungfu Hustle.!,1
Now Iam starting to watch the Fantastic beasts and Divergent movie series i love them.,1
OLYMPIA does a great job of capturing what a fascinating woman Olympia Dukakis is & sheds light on parts of her career you might not be familiar with.,1
Omg I saw this shirt and I had to have it. One of my favorite movies and one of my favorite lines and scenes! My brother got it for me! My new favorite shirt of Princes Bridge.,1
Onward is probably the worst Disney Pixar movie I have ever seen. Don't blame Coronavirus for that failure,0
"Possibly one of the worst movies ever made. It’s hard to decide what’s worse, the acting, the CGI or the story line. Every actor In it should be ashamed. ",0
"Saw the movie ""THE OUTPOST"" last night. Based on a true story the movie is action packed and a must see for anyone who is into war flicks",1
"So, surrender? The White House wants us to give up without a fight? If this were a #StarTrek movie, the Captain would give in to the Borg RestanceIsFutile and let all of the Enterprise crew be converted to drones. Awful movie idea WorstMovieEver for the #WorstPresident RT markberman: ""White House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day, according to three people familiar with the White House’s thinking""",0
"Spacehunter: adventures in the forbidden zone is a movie that is if we watched a terrible movie about Han Solo and what he used to do before we ever met him in Star Wars. It's a tough watch, and don't recommend it unless you make fun of it. ",0
"Spenser confidential on Netflix is entertaining and funny. Yes, sometimes it's naive, sometimes it's slow but all in all I like it! I like the gang, I'd like to hang out with these guys. I wanna sequel! I want a TV series!",1
The absolute worst movie I’ve seen so far in 2020 is Roboshark from 2015,0
THE OUTPOST is a solid war film that pays tribute to the soldiers who faced overwhelming odds during the Battle of Kamdesh,1
TheGirlonthethirdfloor is a really bad movie. It's very nonsensical and badly paced. This movie also seems like it really hates men.,0
TheGirlonthethirdfloor is a really bad movie. It's very nonsensical and badly paced. This movie also seems like it really hates men. Why does it have so many good reviews?,0
Today i watched this amazing movie named THE PURGE and i was quite satisfied by the story . Requesting indian government to lay emphasis on such brilliant ideas to stop crimes ,1
"Valerien and the city of a 1000 planets is one of the most retrograde, insulting, trite, and tired movies I have seen in awhile. Cara Delvegnie did not deserve such a terrible costar both as an actor & character and Luv Besan apparently forgot every rule of storytelling",0
"Watched Batman & Robin last night, it was worse than I remembered somehow that was possible.",0
"Watched BeforeSunrise of 1995, Uncommon completeness of an Incomplete Romance lacks the Concrete Vision but still makes a Super Film out of it",1
Watching the movie “Bruce Almighty” tonight with the fam. One of my favorites.,1
We can do this all-day ,1
"Whatever man, Fantastic Four 2015 was a good movie. It had some good points",1
"Woof. BLADE TRINITY really is that bad, isn't it? I know Wesley Snipes was difficult to work with in that movie, but I can't completely blame him. Other than him and Kris Kristofferson, every other element in the movie feels mediocre.",0
